# The name of the workflow â€” appears in the Actions tab in GitHub
name: External events (repository dispatch)

# Define the event that triggers this workflow

  repository_dispatch:            # This allows the workflow to be triggered externally via the GitHub API
    types: [build]                # Only trigger when the event_type is "build" (from the external API call)

# Define the list of jobs that will run when the event is triggered
jobs:
  echo-a-string:                  # Name of the job (arbitrary)
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest        # Specify the environment (GitHub-hosted Ubuntu runner)

    steps:                        # Steps define the individual commands to run in this job
      - run: echo "repo dispatch" # Simple step to print a string to the logs
